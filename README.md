# Final Paper Replication

This is a replication of the paper *Firearms and accidental deaths: Evidence from the aftermath of the Sandy Hook school shooting* by Phillip B. Levine and Robin McKnight for my Government 1006 final project at Harvard University.

Levine and McKnight (2017) show that in the 5-month period following the Sandy Hook school shooting in December 2012, a large spike in gun sales contributed to an increase in accidental firearm deaths. Their findings conclude that there was a spike in accidental firearm deaths resulting from the increase in exposure, which is confirmed in this replication. I was able to successfully replicate most of Levine and McKnight's results. As an extension to this paper, the original linear regression used to determine the increase in firearm sales per 100,000 popoulation in the post-Sandy Hook period was changed to a Bayesian generalized linear model. Even after this change, the results showing increases in certain states hold, backing the authors' claims. Even though the Sandy Hook shooting showed the need for stricter gun laws, the immediate aftermath of this realization led to the opposite effect as desired: more accidental firearm deaths.
