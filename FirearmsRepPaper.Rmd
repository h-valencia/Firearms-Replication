### Abstract
Levine and McKnight (2017) show that in the 5-month period following the Sandy Hook school shooting in December 2012, a large spike in gun sales contributed to an increase in accidental firearm deaths. Their findings conclude that there was a spike in accidental firearm deaths resulting from the increase in exposure, which is confirmed in this replication. As an extension to this paper, the original linear regression used to determine the increase in firearm sales per 100,000 popoulation in the post-Sandy Hook period was changed to a Bayesian generalized linear model. Even after this change, the resuts showing increases in certain states hold, backing the authors' claims.  Even though the Sandy Hook shooting showed the need for stricter gun laws, the immediate aftermath of this realization led to the opposite effect as desired: more accidental firearm deaths.

### Introduction
This replication paper takes a look at gun sales, background checks, and google search data in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook school shooting that took place on December 14th, 2012. It is hard for one to not know about the atrocities that took place in Newtown, Connecticut that day, as innocent school children and their teachers were murdered at school. Since then, many reforms have been put in place for gun control and school safety alike. In the immediate aftermath, however, gun sales spiked and google searches about buying and cleaning guns soared. People knew that the number of background checks were going to increase to prevent further events like this from happening. This paper analyzes, specifically, whether there was an increase in the number of accidental gun deaths in the five-month period following this event, which could then be attributed to the increase in gun sales. The authors also took a look at accidental firearm deaths by state, so that they could see whether states with a larger increase in firearm sales also had an increase in the accidental deaths. To run this analysis, they calculated death rates among children and among adults and ran regressions, controlling for trends and seasonal patterns. In the end, the authors concluded that "an additional 60 deaths overall, including 20 children,
resulted from unintentional shootings in the immediate aftermath of Sandy Hook" (Levine et al. 1).

Within this replication, I have made three graphs and a table. The first graph details the change in Google searches about cleaning and buying goods in the years leading up to and following Sandy Hook. There is an obvious spike in the data in the post-Sandy Hook window. The second graph looks at "seasonally adjusted, detrended monthly firearm sales and accidental firearm death rates" among children under the age of 15. And finally the third graph shows a map of the US, with each state colored by the amount increase in firearm sales per 100,000 population in the post-Sandy Hook period (December 2012 - April 2013). To create these graphics, I used datasets that were built using R, CDC NCHS data, Stata, and data obtained through Harvard's Dataverse. All the data used to produce this replication can be found on my GitHub repository. ^[My GitHub repo can be found following this url: https://github.com/h-valencia/1006-milestone-4]

### Literature Review
In the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, President Barack Obama took a stance against guns, calling for stricter gun control legislation. After announcing this, Americans became more interested in owning guns, and Levine and McKnight have estimated an additional 3 million guns were sold in the 5-month period following the shooting. Whether people be buying new guns, or revisiting and cleaning ones that have owned for years, the greater exposure to guns following the shooting may have likely driven an increase in the number of accidental deaths caused by firearms, especially amongst children. When former President Obama spoke about the new gun control legislation in mid-January and mid-February of 2013, search activity about guns spiked immediately. In specific states and areas where gun sales spiked, it was found that the number of accidental deaths also spiked. Although this correlation does not a cause and effect relationship, it should be noted.

Within the models created, there are multiple caveats to consider. Many of the models were created using the CDC National Center for Health Statistics's Vital Statistics mortality data, which are known to underestimate accidental firearm deaths. Another consideration that should be made is that this data only accounts for accidental firearm discharges that resulted in death, it does not include any cases where victims survived, therefore providing a lower bound on the issue at hand. The restrictions imposed on the cause of death we are interested in also limits the data to omit any suicides or homicides due to firearm exposure during this time period. The paper in consideration also only displays short-term implications of increased gun exposure, not long term effects.

In an effort to mitigate the likelihood of school shootings, one proposal has been to arm teachers with guns, giving them a way to protect themselves and their students. There have been, however, instances where teachers then use these weapons against themselves or their students, albeit this does not occur frequently (Buck et al.).

As an extension to this paper, the original linear regression used to determine the increase in firearm sales per 100,000 popoulation in the post-Sandy Hook period was changed to a Bayesian generalized linear model. The simulation was run through Stata for each state, giving an estimated mean coefficient, standard deviation, MCSE, and 95% CI. The graph of box plots shows the mean estimate of the coefficient and the bounds of the 95% CI for this coefficient. Even after the change in regression type, the resuts showing increases in certain states hold and the linear model coefficient falls within the CI, backing the authors' claims. The tables sums up the mean estimate for the Bayesian glm models, along with the standard deviation, MCSE, and 95% confidence interval produced from running the Bayesian simulation.
